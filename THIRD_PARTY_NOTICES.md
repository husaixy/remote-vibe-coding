## remote-bridge-hub

- Project: `xxb26553663-star/remote-bridge-hub`
- Source: <https://github.com/xxb26553663-star/remote-bridge-hub>
- Reference revision: `8a93f321ac71a602300c6cd77f7256fa4b63068e`
- License: GNU General Public License v3.0 only (`GPL-3.0-only`)

The Xiaomi RC003 ATVV UUIDs, microphone command behavior, IMA/DVI ADPCM decoding order, capability parsing, and HID usage mapping were adapted from this project. The Windows client also derives from the GPL-3.0-only Windows RC003 implementation in `nijez/open-voice-bridge`; see `apps/windows/rc003/ATTRIBUTION.md` for the file-level attribution and changes. The Windows client does not include any upstream customer data or commercial branding.

## BlackHole

- Project: `ExistentialAudio/BlackHole`
- Source: <https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole>
- Pinned source revision: `v0.7.1` / `e2b22aaaba4e507a097131704bf96dabc004d9cf`
- License: GNU General Public License v3.0 (`GPL-3.0`)

BlackHole remains an optional loopback-device choice. This fork includes `scripts/build-doubao-driver.sh` and `third_party/blackhole/blackhole-device-usb.patch`, which build a distinct `MiRemoteV2ch.driver` from the pinned BlackHole source. The patch changes only the actual Audio Device transport type to USB and assigns a separate CFPlugIn factory UUID; it does not modify an installed `BlackHole2ch.driver`. The release build embeds the derived driver in a dedicated macOS Installer package. End users install that package from the DMG and do not need the source build tools.

## MiRemoteVoice

- Project: `VincentKingHsu/MiRemoteVoice`
- Source: <https://github.com/VincentKingHsu/MiRemoteVoice>
- Reference release: `v1.0.0-beta.1`
- Application license: MIT

The Doubao compatibility design is informed by MiRemoteVoice: a side-by-side BlackHole-derived device reports its actual audio Device as USB transport so Doubao can enumerate it. This fork reimplements that idea as a pinned, source-built BlackHole patch instead of reusing MiRemoteVoice's version-specific binary replacement script.

## RC003 product photo

The RC003 product photo bundled as `RC003-remote-photo.png` was supplied by the user on 2026-07-17 for the physical-button mapping interface. It is preserved at its original 508 x 1030 aspect ratio. Copyright and trademark rights in the photo and depicted products remain with their respective owners; the GPL-3.0-only license for the program does not grant additional rights to this image or the Xiaomi marks.

## VB-CABLE

- Project: `VB-Audio VB-CABLE`
- Source: <https://vb-audio.com/Cable/>
- Package used by the optional Windows helper: `VBCABLE_Driver_Pack45.zip`
- License: VB-Audio Donationware / the vendor's own terms; it is not GPL code

The Windows client does not modify, re-license, silently install, or select
VB-CABLE as the Windows default device. The build helper
`apps/windows/rc003/build/fetch-vb-cable.ps1` downloads and hash-verifies the
official package only as an explicit build step. At runtime, installation is
available only after an explicit user click and a real Windows UAC prompt;
the Remote Mic process never runs with administrator privileges and never reports a driver install as successful merely because a process was launched.
The optional bundle contains only the free Basic package, not the paid A+B/C+D
products. Audio is routed only to the endpoint explicitly selected by the user,
and the application never changes the Windows system default input/output device.
